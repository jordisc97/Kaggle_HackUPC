# HP Supply Chain Optimization

This repository contains the code and resources for the [HP Supply Chain Optimization](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hp-supply-chain-optimization/data) Kaggle competition. The competition focuses on predicting inventory levels for Hewlett-Packard (HP) to optimize their supply chain management.

---

## 🚀 Objective

The primary goal of this project is to predict inventory levels for different products over the next 13 weeks to assist HP in reducing overstocking and understocking scenarios. These predictions will aid in improving supply chain efficiency and overall customer satisfaction.

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset provides information related to HP's supply chain operations. Below are the key files:

### **1. Training Data**
- `train.csv`: Contains historical data on weekly inventory levels for multiple products.
  - **Key Columns**:
    - `Product_ID`: Unique identifier for each product.
    - `Date`: The start date of the week.
    - `Inventory`: Weekly inventory levels.
    - Additional features such as sales, demand, etc.

### **2. Testing Data**
- `test.csv`: Contains data for the next 13 weeks for which predictions need to be made.
  - **Key Columns**:
    - `Product_ID`
    - `Date`

### **3. Additional Files**
- `sample_submission.csv`: A template for the required submission format.
- `data_description.txt`: Documentation of the dataset.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for building models
  - Advanced time series libraries such as `NeuralForecast` or `statsmodels`

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
   - Understand the data structure.
   - Handle missing values, anomalies, and outliers.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Generate lag features, rolling averages, and trend indicators.
   - Include holiday and seasonality data if applicable.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Experiment with various models, such as:
     - Time series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
     - Machine learning models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, LightGBM).

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate predictions using the competition metric (e.g., RMSE, MAE).

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metric

The competition uses **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** as the evaluation metric:

\[
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}
\]

---

## 📑 Submission

- Submissions should be made in the format of `sample_submission.csv`.
- Include predictions for all products and weeks in the test dataset.

---

## 🌟 Results

Once the project is complete, the final model's performance will be benchmarked against the leaderboard.
